    <h2>📌 SQL Question</h2>
    <div class="box">
        <p>
            A company tracks employee visits, allowing only one entry per employee per day, although a loophole 
            exists where employees can enter multiple times if they use a different email ID for each entry.
            <br><br>
            Given this input data, determine:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name of each person</li>
            <li>Total number of times they visited</li>
            <li>The floor they visited the most frequently</li>
            <li>A comma-separated list of distinct resources they used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The output should include: <b>Name, Total Visits, Most Visited Floor, Used Resources</b>.</p>
    </div>

        ) AS rn

-- Final Output
SELECT
